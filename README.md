# Applicant Skill Assessment 🎉

#  🥅 Goal
 
To allow applicants a chance to demonstrate their ability to use modern web techniques to solve the types of problems that this position would encounter.
 
# 🐛 Problem
 
For site visitors who use the Brave browser, our Virtual Tour section does not load. Instead, there is a large blank space where the tour should be. See image below.

</div>

### Pro Tip
The iframe will load on your local file in the Brave Browser. To "see" the bug, open <a href="https://github.com/orumarketing/applicant-skill-assessment/blob/main/index-bugged.html">index-bugged.html</a> for a simulation of what would happen if this file was on a live server.
 

 
# 🏗 Your Task
 
Create a "Fallback" solution so that, in the event the Virtual Tour does not load, the site visitor will still have a visually pleasing way to do the following:
<ol>
  <li>See that there is a Virtual Tour</li>
  <li>View the Virtual Tour with just one click (just like if it was working)</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">Display your solution on your free GitHub page.</a></li>
</ol>
 
**Reminder** The "Fallback" solution should only trigger in situations where the default Virtual Tour does not work.
# 🧑🏽‍⚖️ Rules of Engagement
 
Use Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript. **Do NOT** use any other CSS frameworks besides Bootstrap and **Do NOT** use any Javascript frameworks. Javascript libraries are fair game!

### Focus on the Solution not the Design
This assessment is more concerned with getting a better understanding of how well you identify and solve issues than with your UI design skills. Your solutions responsiveness is more important than the aesthetics. No points will be deducted for using the base Bootstrap styling. Just make sure that the colors match.  
 
# 👩🏽‍🏫 Show and Tell
During interviews, each applicant will be asked to demonstrate their solution, prove it solves the problem, and explain why they believe their solution is the best for the problem. To facilitate a smooth process, place any Javascript or CSS edits in the <a href="https://github.com/orumarketing/applicant-skill-assessment/tree/main/my-solutions">my-solutions folder</a>.
